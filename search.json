One such form is the eigenvector expansion where one solves a simpler problem and assumes that the more difficult problem can be decomposed in a sum of the simpler solutions.  &lt;div dir=”ltr”, style=”text-align: justify;” trbidy=”on”&gt;   This kind of problem generally involves solving the eigenvalue problem of a particular matrix. Assuming that you know how to do that, this is all fine and well. However, it is also common to use orthogonality relations to simplify the solution. For a general matrix $A$, the resulting eigenvectors need not be orthogonal. That’s a problem. Let’s look for a solution.  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div dir=”ltr”, style=”text-align: justify;” trbidy=”on”&gt;   Adopting the braket notation and denoting an eigenvector by $|e_i\rangle$, we seek new vectors such that   To see how we can compute those vectors, consider the original eigenvalue problem   We will use the fact that both sets of eigenvectors are complete so that there exists a closure relation   Now, pre-multipling \eqref{eq:eigenvalue} by $\langle f^j|$ and post-multiplying by $\langle f^i|$ and summing over the index $i$, we get   Using our orthogonality relations on the right-hand side of this last equation and the closure relation on the left-hand side, we get   The Dirac delta makes the sum disappear as usual and we have   In other words, the $\langle f^j|$ are the row eigenvectors of  $A$ and have the same eigenvalues as the set $|e_i\rangle$! &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div dir=”ltr”, style=”text-align: justify;” trbidy=”on”&gt;   So we find that these new “contravariant” vectors are actually the left eigenvectors of the matrix $A$. Moreover, the decomposition of any vector in the original set of covariant vectors is given by the dot product with the vectors in the dual basis. Say we have a vector $|v\rangle$, its decomposition is given by   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div dir=”ltr”, style=”text-align: justify;” trbidy=”on”&gt;   This eigendecomposition is incredibly useful in solving differential equations, smoothing numerically unstable solutions…  &lt;/div&gt;"

      "excerpt"		: "&nbsp; &nbsp;While sipping away at my alcoholic drink, I had, as men usually have, philosophical matters spring to my mind. Wrought body and soul in the shadow of the night, my first instinct was to share my thoughts with the world.&nbsp; &nbsp;In Siddhartha, by Hermann Hesse, a young prodigy of his tribe leaves his home and undertakes a long journey to gain spiritual enlightenment. In the process of knowing himself and the world, he loses himself. He goes against all the teachings of the elders of his tribe and everything he has always known. However, in the end, while not returning to his home, he returns in a state resembling his old state, but with hard-gained knowledge and wisdom.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This very idea of movie through space and time but coming back to a similar place, the notion of the cycles in life, of the cycles in Nature, is interesting to me. For a reason I can&#39;t explain, this is appealing to me. The idea that, through human history, through the succession of generations, I get to live forever. &quot;At the still point of the turning world&quot;, through the center that must hold, where everyone is one and nothing, where the lonely streams become a river, the river of life, I can identify with everything. My &quot;soul is the whole world&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This is indeed very hard to explain. Even T.S. Eliot had problems expressing this idea:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;That was a way of putting it - not very satisfactory:A periphrastic study in a worn-out poetical fashion,Leaving one still with the intolerable wrestleWith words and meanings. The poetry does not matter.although the idea is, verily, quite simple. In a place, where there exists no time and no space, we are one. But not really.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This still point, being defined by the Universe, must be of&nbsp;the Universe. Imagine a rolling wheel. Its center does not move, being the center, but it must rotate as to accompany the wheel. We do not see it turning, but it must. We can relate this analogy to the conclusion of Siddhartha. Carpe Diem. Everything that is the world is beautiful; it must be appreciated and loved and such. Everything has sin and virtue in it.&nbsp; &nbsp;But this isn&#39;t true. It is true only at the still point. What shall we do? Locally, then, an ethics system must be enforced. This ethical system, built by the people inhabiting the region of space and time by the means of logic and reason, must fulfill the requirements and principles of the people.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Globally, this is my interpretation of this. Although I do not think the world completely deterministic, I believe that the entirety of possibilities is contained in the world. At the still point, then, the singularity of the Big Bang, every possible outcome exists and is as one; the future of the Universe is written as the wavefunction fo the Universe. At that time, the river breaks into a million pieces.&nbsp; &nbsp;What did I just say? I am confused.&nbsp;&nbsp;The poetry does not matter, but its equivocacy a way to expose without explaining, a way to confuse and inform.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This is it for now, but I shall return.&nbsp;"

Notice that I appended a _ to the Fortran subroutine names. The extern keyword tells the compiler that a separately compiled object will be used. By default, g++  will append _ to Fortran subroutines when creating an object file. This means that if you change this compiler setting, be sure to remember to change your function declarations in your C++ header file.Also, the functions take pointers to variables. In Fortran, all functions take their arguments by reference. It is thus necessary to use pointers when using Fortran subroutines in C++.&nbsp;You&#39;re done! You can now use your Fortran subroutines in your C++ program! Just don&#39;t forget to add the -lgfortranwhen compiling either the program you are writing or a program that uses a library that uses Fortran subroutines.

As of the fourth project, I am working with a partner, which immediately lead to the classic problem: how do we share the code?&nbsp; &nbsp; Of course, this problem has been solved in thousands of ways. I chose to create an account on SourceForge (I don&#39;t have my own server, so it was the easiest way) and start a project where I could dump the all the code in an SVN repository. (By the way, all the code we write, for what it&#39;s worth, is Creative Commons.)&nbsp; &nbsp;Everything went well; up till yesterday. For some obscure reason, when I tried to svn up&nbsp;in the morning, svn returned the error&nbsp;Reading one svndiff window read beyond the end of the representation.which I didn&#39;t know about. Some Googling informed me that the repository was corrupted. &nbsp;Some more Googling revealed a SourceForge support page that gave a solution to the problem.&nbsp; &nbsp;Okay, so here&#39;s the complete solution. You log on to the Shell SourceForge provide and run the following commands:adminrepo --checkout svnsvnadmin dump -r 0:92 /svnroot/projectName/ &gt; ~/repo.dumpThe adminrepo checks out the SVN repo of your project in a folder that you can modify. You then dump the repo (I used -r 0:92 because I knew the repo was sane at rev 92 and because I had manually merged the diffs of -r 93:95 in my working directory).&nbsp; &nbsp;Now, if you&#39;re sure you have a good backup, you can delete the repo. We will then create a new one and load the dump file into this new repo.rm -rf /svnroot/projectName/svnadmin create /svnroot/projectNameadminrepo --save svnNow half the fun is done. The repo is back in the main folder (which you can&#39;t modify directly) and your DB should be un-corrupted (or whatever).&nbsp; &nbsp;If you&#39;re using the new SourceForge bashboard, you can&#39;t stop here. You have to tell the dashboard that you&#39;ve made some drastic changes to the repo. In the SourceForge web interface, navigate to Admin → Tools. Under the SVN tool, click on Import Repo. Enter the following URL:https://projectName.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/projectNameclick Import and you&#39;re done!&nbsp;Please inform me in the comments is something is unclear or just plain wrong.

      "excerpt"		: "&nbsp; &nbsp;This last semester, I took a course intitled Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos&nbsp;(in &nbsp;French). It was quite a novelty, as undergraduates in physics mostly deal with linear problems (they are much easier to solve analytically. Most nonlinear systems do not possess such solutions and they do, the&nbsp;analytic&nbsp;expression is so complex that it offers no qualitative understanding of the subject.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A dynamicist must make use of a completely different set of tools, mostly numeric, to try to grasp the inner workings of a particular system. Phase space, which shows the relationship between a variable and its nth order derivatives (where n is the dynamical order of the system, if I can use this vocabulary), is an important example of these tools.&nbsp; &nbsp;In the special context of Hamiltonian mechanics, where momenta and position are related through what is called a symplectic symmetry, the topology of the phase space trajectories are significantly restricted; they are N-tori. That is, as long as the system is integrable (has a closed form solution).&nbsp; &nbsp;As soon as a perturbation is added that renders the system non-integrable, then the phase space qualitatively evolves as described by what is called the KAM Theorem.This last theorem was the main topic of a mini research project that was conducted by Raphaël Dubé-Demers and myself&nbsp;throughout&nbsp;the second half of the semester. Following these last few words are the text produced during this research and the Beamer presentation used to introduce the subject to our peers.Happy reading![Presentation]&nbsp;&nbsp;(in French)[Text]&nbsp; (in French)To anyone that will ask nicely, I could translate it in English. Asked very nicely!UPDATE: I made a flipbook out of it. It looks pretty cool, but that&#39;s pretty much it!UPDATE 2: Here&#39;s the link to the complete thing.To view this flipping book you need to have Flash Player 9 or newer installed and JavaScript enabled.

So, there you go:[ \oint_{\partial\mathcal{V}} \mathbf{g}\cdot d\mathbf{A}= -4\pi GM]where $\mathbf{g}$ is the gravitational field, $d\mathbf{A}$ is a differential, oriented piece of area, $G$ is the gravitational constant and $M$ is the mass comprised by the volume described by the surface $\partial V$.This is going to be so cool!"

      "excerpt"		: "&nbsp;&nbsp;I recently ran into a seemingly severe problem with my computer. Since approximately 2003, I&#39;ve been using Linux as my primary desktop. I have enjoyed the learning that inevitably came out of it, and have also joined the great community of Linux users.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyhow, when I booted my computer yesterday, the boot screen said that it couldn&#39;t not mount the local file systems, saying something along these lines:Cannot link ... to /etc/mtabPerhaps there is a stale lock file?(I don&#39;t remember the exact error statement.) So, I did not have access to my /boot, /home, /var and other partitions on my hard drive. No X either. In short, my computer was unusable, as I did not have the necesarry files.&nbsp;I immediatly Googled the issue[*] and eventually found a solution:sudo rm /etc/mtab~This seemed to correct the issue without any consequence to the rest of the system. Of course, don&#39;t delete the /etc/mtab file proper, but the temporary file marked by the tilde.&nbsp;&nbsp;I later found out that this problem originated from Transmission BitTorrent Client. An option in the software allows it to keep your computer to go to sleep, probably creating that /etc/mtab~ file in the process. I did some testing and it seems that it is well behaved about it, i.e. if you let it close properly, it will remove the lock file and allow your computer to sleep or shut down.&nbsp;Anyhow, in the hope that that helps someone. Oh, by the way, I&#39;m using Arch Linux 64-bit.&nbsp;[*]&nbsp;On my iPod Touch because I still do not know how to connect to a WPA-protected access point with the command line.&nbsp;"

However, they failed to mention one small detail.I tried this when it went out the first time. For some reason, I received notifications in the form of badges for my Gmail e-mail, but nothing for Google Calendar. The answer to that problem is, in fact, very simple.I switched the calendar feed from Exchange to Gmail itself, which solved the problem.

The original Greek expression is ὅπερ ἔδει δεῖξαι and means &quot;precisely what was to be proved&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, Euclid&#39;s way of concluding proofs has been preserved throughout the centuries to end up in our modern world approximately unchanged.
