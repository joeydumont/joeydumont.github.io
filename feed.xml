This year’s listicle is brought to you by the great work of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/progmetal">r/ProgMetal folks</a> and their very handy <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fQFg52uaojpRCz29EzSHVpsX5SYVJ2VN8IuKs9XA5W8/edit#gid=1933120972">spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<p>So, in no particular order, and not even my going by <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/valandil211/library/albums?from=2021-01-01&amp;rangetype=year">my most listened albums</a> this year, here are some thoughts about the albums which left good impressions on me in 2021.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Wilson, who brought us, in my opinion, the definitive versions of Deliverance &amp; Damnation, has been productive in his solo musical career as well. The overall effort that is <em>The Futures Bites</em> definitely rivals <em>Hand. Cannot. Erase.</em>, and the insane banger <em>Personal Shopper</em> is definitely the song of the year. It is instantly catchy, yet interesting enough to be worth a second, third, or <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/valandil211/library/music/Steven+Wilson/The+Future+Bites?from=2021-01-01&amp;rangetype=year">50th</a> listen.</p>

<p><em>The Future Bites</em> sees Wilson embrace his love for electronic music in his solo albums (he’s definitely explored this in other projects). While he had previously explored mixing progressive and electronic elements within a single song, <em>Personal Shopper</em> is a fully electronic banger.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I might show some slight local bias here, but Gaspard is one my favourite discoveries of the year. The band describes themselves as being driven by the musical exploration of musical landscapes, and this album (as well as their previous one) delivers on this premise. The sometimes atmospheric and sometimes quite heavy riffs of the album are well balanced, and play off each other very well.</p>

<p>I also recommend their first release: <em>La Forêt de Gaspard</em>, of which Vestiges is pretty much an evolution. It is a study in textures and atmosphere.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>While the previous entry on this list is a slow exploration of a supernatural landscape, <em>The Stuff of Legends</em> is compact and energetic half-hour of satisfying math rock riffs with some great solos. This fast-paced album captures your attention for its entirety.</p>

<p>Their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=in8jgULPzjg">music video for The Great Calamity</a> is also pretty fun.</p>

<p>I hadn’t yet followed Alice down the hole of avant-garde metal, but this album by Diablo Swing Orchestra made me fall hard. The eclectic mix of prog, heavy metal, folk, and other genres, could make for a disjointed listen, but it is so well done that is actually just refreshing, and keeps you on your toes the whole album. <em>Speed Dating an Arsonist</em> is my favourite track of the album for its catchy bits, funny lyrics, and satisfying finish, but the entire album is worth a listen.</p>

<p>This is my first DSO album, and I definitely plan on going through their earlier work in 2022.</p>

<p>Home Brewed Universe is the one-man band backed by Arka Sengupta from Hyderabad, India.
Fear of an Obtuse Earth was an early coup de coeur for me. It came out on January 25th, just before Vertiges. I was immediately enthralled by the rough metal sound, and the interesting
prog melodies.</p>

<p>It suffers from a bit of repetition towards the end though. Home Brewed Universe also release Tranquil Taboo Time this year, which feels a bit more of the same, and suffers from the same repetition issue.</p>

<p>Like the entry above, Australian band Teramaze released two full-length albums this year. While Sorella Minore unfortunately suffers from the 2112 syndrome, it also has its redeeming quality in that the the bombastic first track is makes it an excellent album. At once both easily digested and surviving more attentive listens, the 25-minute epic manages to make you forget its length by carefully layering complex compositions as time goes on.</p>

<p>This album is a continuation of the story set forth in <em>Her Halo</em>, but I must admit I haven’t paid too much attention to the lyrics. Even skipping the story element, the four vocalists put on an amazing performance.</p>

<p>It is always good to discover a band with a female vocalist who can do both clean and harsh vocals, especially when it is a local band! Vicky Psarakis, who’s been with the band for their last 4 releases now, is heavily showcased through the album, and to the benefit of the album.</p>

<p>Dark Horse White Horse is a collaboration between Marcela Bovio, Ruben Wijga, and Jord Otto, the last two both ex-ReVamp. This heavy album is a 22-minute compact EP that showcases each member’s talent. Mixed by Joost van den Broek, this record is definitely heavier than what I’m used to hearing from Bovio, who I have mostly heard through the lens of Arjen Lucassen’s rock operatic universe, and it works quite well with her vocal style.</p>

<p>A very good album to scratch that Alkaloid itch. <em>The Great Designer</em>, the album’s opening song, could be a continuation of <em>Rise of the Cephalopods</em>, as they somewhat similar in composition and theme. I pretty much like anything Hannes Grossman produces, so any negative comment should be taken as being relative to his other work. While I found Alkaloid’s albums to be stonger overall, I very much enjoyed <em>To Where the Light Retreats</em>. It has the characteristic heaviness and technical prowess of his other work, but manages to be distinct while not feeling too incremental.</p>

<p>It is impressive how Iron Maiden has consistently put out high quality records throughout their entire career (bar a few exceptions). While the titular opener is strong, my favourite part of the album is definitely the three closers: <em>Death of the Celts</em>, <em>The Parchment</em>, <em>Hell on Earth</em>. It seems that Maiden recently started liking longer songs again (all three songs have runtime upwards of 10 minutes), and I can only approve.</p>

<p>DT’s outings in the last couple years have been hit-and-miss for me, but <em>A View from the Top of the World</em> sees them returning to their more traditional formula, and it is a definitive success.
Like Maiden’s Senjutsu, this record boasts of a stronger opener and an amazing closing trio. The titular song, which is a 20-minute epic, doesn’t have the same impact as my nostalgia-coloured memory believes, say, <em>Octavarium</em>, to have, it is definitely a masterpiece of the genre. John Petrucci seems to have finally reached the speed that <a href="https://youtu.be/JT5VUcRYNAg">Mikael Åkerfeldt reckons he has</a>.</p>

<h3 id="honourable-mentions">Honourable Mentions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://duplicaterecords.bandcamp.com/album/the-hollow-man">Void – The Hollow Man</a></strong> Based on the T.S. Eliot poem of the same name. I love their interpretation of the poems, even if black metal is not my favourite genre.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://mftj.bandcamp.com/album/my-moms-getting-a-horse">MFTJ – My Mom’s Getting a Horse</a></strong> Zappa-esque rhythms, quite quirky. The guitarist, Mike Keneally, was involved in the Zappa 1988 tour and is quite accomplished. Scott Schorr, the other half of the two-man band, has been involved in the prog scene as a producer for decades.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://acrylazea.bandcamp.com/album/a-cavalcade-of-cosmic-calamity">Acrylazea – A Cavalcade of Cosmic Calamity</a></strong> An interesting blend of genres, with Unexpect influences. Similar to DSO. (Another avant-garde metal? I apparently have a new favourite genre.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://keor.bandcamp.com/album/tearoom">Keor – Tearoom</a></strong> Clean riffs, and good musicianship. A good all-around album. It bills itself as emotionally explosive, and I think Keor delivers this with Tearoom. <em>LEARNING GOD</em> especially.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://i-voidhangerrecords.bandcamp.com/album/solar-drone-ceremony">Neptunian Maximalism – Solar Drone Ceremony</a></strong> Definitely something that needs to be listened to multiple times to be digested, studied, and understood. I found it a little too over the top to make the list. <a href="https://www.angrymetalguy.com/neptunian-maximalism-solar-drone-ceremony-review/">Angry Metal Guy</a> recommends their earlier <em>Éons</em> however, so I’ll probably take some time to look into Neptunian Maximalism.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://othersbynoone.bandcamp.com/album/book-ii-where-stories-come-from">Others By No One – Book II: Where Stories Come From</a></strong> Not sure if genius or insane.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://prospectorsnl.bandcamp.com/album/proven-lands">Prospectors – Proven Lands</a></strong> Another avant-garde album, definitely my favourite genre of the year. Or maybe I just enjoy experimentation and exploration in music. This debut album has an interesting mix of aggressive parts, but also slower build-ups leading to cathartic releases that I’ve come up to expect of prog-rock albums.</p>

If
not, I recommend this <a href="http://www.ifp.illinois.edu/~nakazato/tips/xgcc.html#binutil">succinct guide</a>, or this <a href="https://preshing.com/20141119/how-to-build-a-gcc-cross-compiler">longer guide</a> if you want
to have some context.</p>

<p>On x86_64 architectures, building gcc such that it can generate both 32- and
64-bit code is easy: just use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--enable-multilib</code> flag at configuration
time, and everything will follow smoothly (see Arch Linux’s PKGBUILD for
<a href="https://git.archlinux.org/svntogit/packages.git/tree/trunk/PKGBUILD?h=packages/gcc">gcc</a>, the packaging is a bit more complicated, but the build itself is
simple).</p>

<p>It is not as easy when targeting the MIPS architecture, specifically
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mips64-elf</code>. By default, the 32-bit ABIs are not part of the multilib setup.
gcc exposes the multilib setup that was used to compile a toolchain via the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-print-multi-lib</code> option. On your own x86_64 system, you should see something
similar to this (assuming you have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gcc-multilib</code> on your system)</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>valandil ~ <span class="nv">$ </span>gcc <span class="nt">-print-multi-lib</span>
.<span class="p">;</span>
32<span class="p">;</span>@m32
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>where the second line shows the use of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-m32</code> in the build options for the gcc
toolchain itself, and the libraries are stored in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">32/</code> directory. This
toolchain is thus comprised of two sets of GCC libraries, one compiled with
default options, and one with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-m32</code>.</p>

<p>If you had installed a mips64-elf toolchain with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--enable-multilib</code>, by default
you would get the following output</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>valandil ~ <span class="nv">$ </span>mips64-elf-gcc <span class="nt">-print-multi-lib</span>
.<span class="p">;</span>
soft-float<span class="p">;</span>@msoft-float
el<span class="p">;</span>@EL
soft-float/el<span class="p">;</span>@msoft-float@EL
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In order to enable other ABIs, specify other build options for the GCC libraries
in general, you need to know about <em><a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs//gcc-3.4.5/gccint/Target-Fragment.html">Target makefile
fragments</a></em>.</p>

<p>In short, target Makefile fragments are the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gcc/config/&lt;target&gt;/t*</code> files in
gcc’s source tree. When you specify a target at the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">configure</code> step, it looks
for those in order to generate the Makefile that will actually build the gcc
libraries <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. For a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mips64-elf</code> target, the file that is of interest to us is
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gcc/config/mips/t-elf</code> file. By default, it sets three Makefile variables</p>

<div class="language-make highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">MULTILIB_OPTIONS</span> <span class="o">=</span> msoft-float EL/EB
<span class="nv">MULTILIB_DIRNAMES</span> <span class="o">=</span> soft-float el eb
<span class="nv">MULTILIB_MATCHES</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">EL</span><span class="o">=</span>mel <span class="nv">EB</span><span class="o">=</span>meb msingle-float<span class="o">=</span>m4650
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which instructs the gcc build system to generate libraries for combinations of
these three build flags. Flags that are separated by a space are combined, while
incompatible flag are separated with a slash. It is this fragment that generated
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mips64-elf-gcc -print-multi-lib</code> output that we saw above.</p>

<p>So, if you want to generate libraries for other ABIs, you simply edit (or create
a new one!) that file to what you need. In my case, I wanted to have libraries
compiled with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-mabi=32</code>, at it is the ABI used by most N64 games. So, I edited
my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">t-elf</code> fragment to be</p>

<div class="language-make highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">MULTILIB_OPTIONS</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">mabi</span><span class="o">=</span>32 msoft-float EL/EB
<span class="nv">MULTILIB_DIRNAMES</span> <span class="o">=</span> 32 soft-float el eb
<span class="nv">MULTILIB_MATCHES</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">EL</span><span class="o">=</span>mel <span class="nv">EB</span><span class="o">=</span>meb msingle-float<span class="o">=</span>m4650
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you were to compile this toolchain, you would get the following
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-print-multib-lib</code> output:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>.<span class="p">;</span>
32<span class="p">;</span>@mabi<span class="o">=</span>32
soft-float<span class="p">;</span>@msoft-float
el<span class="p">;</span>@EL
soft-float/el<span class="p">;</span>@msoft-float@EL
32/soft-float<span class="p">;</span>@mabi<span class="o">=</span>32@msoft-float
32/el<span class="p">;</span>@mabi<span class="o">=</span>32@EL
32/soft-float/el<span class="p">;</span>@mabi<span class="o">=</span>32@msoft-float@EL
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MULTILIB_DIRNAMES</code> controls the name of the folder in which the libraries
reside. Note that this corresponds to the information before the semi-colon in
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-print-multilib-output</code>, while the string after describes the build
options, prepended with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@</code>. and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MULTILIB_MATCHES</code> provides the synonyms of
some build options.</p>

<p>There are other options than those discussed here. Feel free to read the
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs//gcc-3.4.5/gccint/Fragments.html#Fragments">Makefile

wavefront of optical beams. They are used in ophthalmology <a class="citation" href="#Thibos2000"> [1]</a>, microscopy, and laser metrology, among others <a class="citation" href="#Wyant1992"> [2]</a>. Because they are orthogonal on the unit disk, they are most
suitable to describe deviations from a flat phase front in a single transverse
plane of the beam.</p>

<p>They are given by</p>

\[\begin{align}
    Z_{n}^{m}(\rho,\phi) &amp;=  R_{n}^{m}(\rho)\cos(m\phi)      &amp; (m\geq0) \\
    Z_{n}^{m}(\rho,\phi) &amp;=  R_{n}^{|m|}(\rho)\sin(|m|\phi)  &amp; (m&lt;0)
\end{align}\]

<p>where we can verify that they are indeed orthogonal on the unit disk:</p>

\[\int_0^1\int_0^{2\pi} Z_{n}^{m}Z_{n'}^{m'}\rho d\rho d\phi
    = \frac{(1+\delta_{m,0})\pi}{2n+2}\delta_{n,n'}\delta_{m,m'}.\]

<p>For a given value of \(n\in\{\{0\}\cup\mathbb{N}\}=\mathbb{N}_0\), the possible
\(m\) values are in the range \(m\in\{-n,n\}\) and increase in increments of 2.
To simplify the enumeration of Zernike polynomials, various linear index schemes
have been devised. In short, each possible pair of \((n,m)\) is assigned to a
monotonically increasing index that we will denote \(j\). In this post, we’ll go
over some index schemes and write Python scripts that will allow us to map form
the linear index \(j\) to the quantum pair \((n,m)\). First, however, it will be
useful to investigate the structure of the pairs.</p>

<h3 id="the-triangular-structure-of-the-quantum-pairs">The Triangular Structure of the Quantum Pairs</h3>

<p>By simply enumerating the quantum pairs and arranging them on a grid where
rows indicate the value of \(n\) and columns the value of \(m\), their triangular
structure becomes readily apparent.</p>

\[\begin{matrix}
             &amp;            &amp;            &amp;  (0,0)   &amp;           &amp;           &amp;            \\
             &amp;            &amp;   (1,-1)   &amp;          &amp;   (1,1)   &amp;           &amp;            \\
             &amp;   (2,-2)   &amp;            &amp;  (2,0)   &amp;           &amp;   (2,2)   &amp;            \\
   (3,-3)    &amp;            &amp;   (3,-1)   &amp;          &amp;   (3,1)   &amp;           &amp; (3,3)
\end{matrix}\]

<p>Since each row contains one element more than the previous row, the number of
elements contained in the first \(k\) rows is given by the \(k\)th triangular
number \(T_k\), defined by</p>

\[T_k = \sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}.\]

<p>For index systems that are monotonic in \(n\), i.e. most of them,  we can
directly relate the quantum number \(n\) to the index of the smallest triangular
number larger than \(j\). Fortunately, the index can easily be determined via
the formula <a class="citation" href="#DAurizio2015"> [3]</a></p>

\[k = \left\lceil \frac{1+\sqrt{1+8j}}{2} \right\rceil - 1.\]

<p>The remainder \(r=j-T_k+n\) can then be used to determine what column corresponds
to that particular \(j\) value. The various linear schemes use different rules
to assign a column to the remainder.</p>

<h3 id="noll-indices">Noll Indices</h3>

<p>The rules to assign the Noll index is to have it monotonic in \(n\) and then
assign in order of increasing \(|m|\), where odd indices correspond to negative
values of \(m\) and even indices to positive values of \(m\). The correspondence
between the Noll indices and the quantum pairs is the subject of OEIS sequence
A176988 <a class="citation" href="#A176988"> [4]</a>.</p>

<p>Since the Noll indices start at 1, the first quantum number can be written
as one less than the triangular number index, \(n=k-1\).</p>

<p>The \(m\) value can be computed from the remainder \(r=j-T_k+n\). The latter can
serve as an index into the list <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">m = [k  for k in range(-n,n+2,2)]</code>, as it
guaranteed to lie in the range \([0,n-1]\). Because of the rules governing the
assignment of signs, using the remainder directly as an index into this list is
rather tedious. A simpler way is to create a list that generates all the
possible values of \(|m|\) and sort them in ascending order. For \(n=3\), that
list would be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[1,1,3,3]</code>. \(r\) can be used as an index in this list to
determine the value of \(|m|\). The sign is then decided by the parity of \(j\)
directly, as stated by the Noll rules.</p>

<p>Here’s the Python code that implements this (a C++ implementation is available
as part of my
<a href="https://github.com/joeydumont/zernike/blob/9eff81ebec7f0ef579ff01bfaabe23ff7ce8291c/src/zernike_indices.cpp#L41">Zernike</a>

<p>but in practice I found the code above to be faster, even though
it generated a larger bytecode than the one-liner version.</p>

<p>Let’s work through an example value.
For instance, suppose that we have \(j=8\), then the formula above \(k=4\) and thus \(n=3\).
The remainder is \(r=8-10+3=1\). From our list above, we have that \(|m|=1\).
Since \(j\) is even, \(m\) is positive, and we have \(m=1\).
And indeed, \((j=8)\mapsto(3,1)\).</p>

<h3 id="phasics-indices">Phasics Indices</h3>

<p>The Phasics index system is monotonic in \(n\), as Noll’s is, and also monotonic
in \(|m|\). However, this system elects to always assign positive values of
\(m\) to lower linear indices, regardless of parity, as stated in the SID4 6.4
User Handbook, Chapter 6.</p>

<p>From these characteristics, we see that Noll and Phasics only differ on rows
where \(T_n\) is even, as  We can thus use the same basic function above, but
add the single-line</p>

post-processing and data analysis. A major annoyance is that NumPy’s
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">genfromtxt</code> does not recognize the C++ complex number format.</p>

<p>Of course, one could write their own I/O for their C++ production codes, but
most libraries have built-in I/O functions and it’s just a pain. It’s much
easier to get Python to read the C++ format!</p>

<h3 id="the-issue">The Issue</h3>

<p>C++ represents a given complex number \(z=a+ib\) as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(a,b)</code>. When using
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">genfromtxt</code> to read a file containing an array of complex numbers, the obvious</p>
<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">numpy</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">np</span>
<span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">np</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">genfromtxt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"file"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">dtype</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nb">complex</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>yields <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NaN</code>s for the real part and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code>s for the imaginary part. To get Python
to understand the format, an easy solution is to first parse the elements of the
array as strings, then use a lambda function to effectively cast the strings
as complex numbers. Here’s the code.</p>

<h3 id="the-code">The Code</h3>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">LoadComplexData</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">file</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="o">**</span><span class="n">genfromtext_args</span><span class="p">):</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nf">complex_parser</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">array_as_strings</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>First, we load the array of complex numbers as an array of strings in Python.
Then, we use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">np.vectorize</code> to define a callable that takes each of the array
and applies the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">complex(*eval(x))</code> to it. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">eval()</code> takes the string and evaluates
it to a tuple of floats. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*</code> operator unpacks the tuple such that we are calling
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">complex(a,b)</code> properly. This returns a complex number in Python format.</p>

<p>A solution based on a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">genfromtxt</code> converter could be more elegant, but I wasn’t
able to find a way to apply a converter to every column of the input file
instead of a specific column.</p>

that go above and beyond in explaining the behind-the-scenes of tunnelling
VNC connections through SSH. Note that this solution uses TigerVNC’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x0vncserver</code>
to control the remote X server. Simply use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vncserver</code> if you want to control
a different X server.</p>

<p>The setup is quite simple, but requires two terminal windows. In the first terminal,
SSH into your remote machine with</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><b>user@local-machine <span class="nv">$ </span></b>ssh -Y &lt;remote.machine.com&gt; -L 5900:localhost:5900
</code></pre></div>

<p>and then,</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><b>remoteuser@remote-machine <span class="nv">$ </span></b> x0vncserver -display :0 -passwordfile ~/.vnc/passwd
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now, in the second terminal on your local machine, you can simply type</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code><b>user@local-machine <span class="nv">$</span></b> vncviewer localhost:5900
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-L</code> flag in the SSH connection sets up port forwarding from the local machine
to the remote machine. In short, all unbound traffic that goes through the specified
port on the local machine is forward to the other port on the remote machine. Here we
choose port 5900 on both machines as it is the default port for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x0vncserver</code>,
but both can be changed freely.</p>

<p>Make sure to generate a password file for VNC by using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vncpasswd</code> and pass
it to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x0vncserver</code> on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">passwordfile</code> flag. Here we choose the default.</p>

<p>The same method with generic ports would read</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><b>user@local-machine <span class="nv">$ </span></b>ssh -Y &lt;remote.machine.com&gt; -L &lt;xxxx&gt;:localhost:&lt;yyyy&gt;
<b>remoteuser@remote-machine <span class="nv">$ </span></b> x0vncserver -rfbport &lt;yyyy&gt; -display :0 \
                                         -passwordfile ~/.vnc/passwd
</code></pre></div>

<div style="text-indent: 0">and</div>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><b>user@local-machine <span class="nv">$</span></b> vncviewer localhost:&lt;xxxx&gt;
</code></pre></div>

<p>Until next time, cheers!</p>]]></content><author><name>Joey Dumont</name><email>me@joey-dumont.ca</email></author><category term="vnc" /><category term="ssh" /><category term="remote desktop" /><category term="linux" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I won’t go into too much detail in this post, as there are multiple guides that go above and beyond in explaining the behind-the-scenes of tunnelling VNC connections through SSH.

In the Queen of Sorcery book [2,p.222], originally published in 1982, it is revealed that Count Reldegen, an Asturian, is limping. This sparks the following conversation: "What happened to your leg?" Wolf asked him. "An arrow in the knee." The count shrugged.Yes, that's right, an arrow in the knee! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now go read The Belgariad so you know why it matters that Reldegen is an Asturian. [1] Amateurish introductory line, I know.[2] D. Eddings. Queen of Sorcery in The Belgariad. 2002. New York: Ballantine.]]></summary></entry></feed>
