<title>Integrability and Chaos in Hamiltonian Systems &#8211; Study of Nature</title>
<meta name="description" content="&nbsp; &nbsp;This last semester, I took a course intitled Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos&nbsp;(in &nbsp;French). It was quite a novelty, as undergraduates in physics mostly deal with linear problems (they are much easier to solve analytically. Most nonlinear systems do not possess such solutions and they do, the&nbsp;analytic&nbsp;expression is so complex that it offers no qualitative understanding of the subject.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A dynamicist must make use of a completely different set of tools, mostly numeric, to try to grasp the inner workings of a particular system. Phase space, which shows the relationship between a variable and its nth order derivatives (where n is the dynamical order of the system, if I can use this vocabulary), is an important example of these tools.&nbsp; &nbsp;In the special context of Hamiltonian mechanics, where momenta and position are related through what is called a symplectic symmetry, the topology of the phase space trajectories are significantly restricted; they are N-tori. That is, as long as the system is integrable (has a closed form solution).&nbsp; &nbsp;As soon as a perturbation is added that renders the system non-integrable, then the phase space qualitatively evolves as described by what is called the KAM Theorem.This last theorem was the main topic of a mini research project that was conducted by Raphaël Dubé-Demers and myself&nbsp;throughout&nbsp;the second half of the semester.
