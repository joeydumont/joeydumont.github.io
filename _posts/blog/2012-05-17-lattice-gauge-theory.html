<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp;During the Winter 2012 semester at U. Laval, I took a Particle Physics course. I'm not sure of the exact appelation in English, but it was given as directed reading (<i>lectures dirig√©es</i>). I didn't have classes: only the reference book.<br /><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp;None of that really matters anyway. The course culminated into an exploration of Lattice Gauge Theory by us two undergrad students. The resulting text is more a collection of interesting results or, in other words, an elementary review of the basics of the theory.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp;The <a href="http://feynman.phy.ulaval.ca/marleau/pp/12jaugesurreseau/index.html" target="_blank">PDF document</a> is available on the website we made for the project. Again, French only.&nbsp;</div></div>
