<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;" trbidi="on">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Nexus 4 prompted me last night for permission to update Gmail and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.calendar&amp;hl=en">Google Calendar</a>. I must say, while Gmail looks slightly better than it did, GCal has received a much needed revamp, especially the widget. I do not have a screenshot of the previous version, but the colour scheme was terrible and the layout was such that it was hard to determine the division between days. It was also very difficult to quickly glance at a calendar to get some information.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0-HLzdJuoyE/VGJ3BDRi4iI/AAAAAAAAEAE/akFfFqq0RcM/s1600/Screenshot_2014-11-11-15-36-33.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0-HLzdJuoyE/VGJ3BDRi4iI/AAAAAAAAEAE/akFfFqq0RcM/s320/Screenshot_2014-11-11-15-36-33.png" width="192" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">A screenshot of the new GCal widget<br />on my Nexus 4.</td></tr></tbody></table>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new version, released yesterday, has received the "Material Design" treatment; the colours are a little more tame, and the division between events and dates is much clearer. Worth the (free) update.<br /><br />I guess I'm saying I like the new designs of Google.</div>
