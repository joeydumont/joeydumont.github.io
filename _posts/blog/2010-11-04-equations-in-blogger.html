&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweet! I can use equations in Blogger! I mean, LaTeX equations. This <a href="http://a2mstats.blogspot.com/2010/04/writing-equation-in-blogger-using-latex.html">site</a> has designed a script that allows LaTeX code to be used in Blogger. So I can present Gauss' Law for gravity in a very clear manner, as I now have the tool to do it. So, there you go:<br />\[ \oint_{\partial\mathcal{V}} \mathbf{g}\cdot d\mathbf{A}= -4\pi GM\]<br />where $\mathbf{g}$ is the gravitational field, $d\mathbf{A}$ is a differential, oriented piece of area, $G$ is the gravitational constant and $M$ is the mass comprised by the volume described by the surface $\partial V$.<br /><br />This is going to be so cool!
