<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So my wife was re-reading the epic fantasy pentalogy <i>The Belgariad </i>by David Eddings [1]. It's a fantastic coming-of-age, prophecy-fulfilling, magic-filled story. Every character is fully developed and they are all thoroughly likable.  <br /><br /><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;" trbidi="on">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But now to the important part. In the <i>Queen of Sorcery</i> book [2,p.222], originally published in 1982, it is revealed that Count Reldegen, an Asturian, is limping. This sparks the following conversation: <br /><blockquote>"What happened to your leg?" Wolf asked him. <br />"An arrow in the knee." The count shrugged.</blockquote>Yes, that's right, an <i>arrow in the knee</i>!   </div><br /><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;" trbidi="on">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now go read <i>The Belgariad</i> so you know why it matters that Reldegen is an Asturian.  </div><br /><div id="#ft1">[1] Amateurish introductory line, I know.</div><div id="#ft2">[2] D.
