&nbsp;Recently, Google updated its <a href="http://www.google.com/mobile/google-mobile-app/">Google Mobile app</a> for the iPhone/iPod touch. Lifehacker almost instantly <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5619730/google-mobile-brings-true-iphone-push-notifications-for-gmail-and-google-calendar">pushed out the information </a>to the geeks. However, they failed to mention one small detail.<br /><br />I tried this when it went out the first time. For some reason, I received notifications in the form of badges for my Gmail e-mail, but nothing for Google Calendar. The answer to that problem is, in fact, very simple.<br /><br />I switched the calendar feed from Exchange to Gmail itself, which solved the problem. I did that to get <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5670967/how-to-sync-your-calendar-colors-between-google-calendar-and-ios">colour sync</a> from Google Calendar and the Calendar app on the iPod Touch &nbsp;and I suddenly began receiving push notifications from GCal!<br /><br />Yay!
