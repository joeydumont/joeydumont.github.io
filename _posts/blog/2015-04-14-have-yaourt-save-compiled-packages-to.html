<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The title of this post might not mean much to most of you, but for those few lucky enough to use Arch Linux on a daily basis, this could be of use to you. By default, <i>yaourt</i> does not keep the package files it produces, it deletes them after installation. Since the AUR deals mostly with unsupported packages, making it  imperative that you be able to roll back to older packages, this is not useful default behaviour. <br /><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;" trbidi="on">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have yaourt export your compiled packages to the standard location, /var/cache/pacman/pkg/, edit /etc/yaourtrc and change the line  <br /><blockquote>#EXPORT=0</blockquote>to   <br /><blockquote>EXPORT=2</blockquote>That is all. Have a nice day!  </div></div>
