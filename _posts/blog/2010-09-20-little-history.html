<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been doing a little research on the origins of Q.E.D., the latin expression that is usually used to conclude mathematical proofs. Turns out it was Euclid that started it all about 2300 years ago. The original Greek expression is ὅπερ ἔδει δεῖξαι and means "precisely what was to be proved".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, Euclid's way of concluding proofs has been preserved throughout the centuries to end up in our modern world approximately unchanged. It has only been translated from Greek to Latin as "quod erat demonstrandum", which means "which that was to be proved".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will include two documents that contain much of the information I have obtained from different websites and books. The history of it is pretty interesting.<br /><br /><a href="https://docs.google.com/fileview?id=0B1k3geX3BgI7MmEzNjFmMzAtYzRjYS00NjIwLTg4MjItNDQ1ZGZkMDAwYWMx&amp;hl=en_GB">QED -- A&nbsp;short document</a><br /><a href="https://docs.google.com/fileview?id=0B1k3geX3BgI7YWI5MTBmODQtZDAzOS00NmE2LTk4ZTMtNTIxOGM3OGUzMWZm&amp;hl=en_GB">QED -- A Beamer presentation</a><br /><br /></div>
