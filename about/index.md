title: About me
excerpt: "A somewhat intelligent person with limited social skills."

Hi! I am a technical advisor at the National Research Council of Canada. My main
responsibility is to help researchers migrate their high-performance computing
workloads to the cloud, using either traditional approaches or cloud native
tools.

I've also acted as a managed service provider to support the research functions
of the NRC by using both on-premise infrastructure and cloud infrastructure as
the backend. For instance, I have leveraged S3 to backup protected research data
sets.

As part of our group's mandate, I help maintain our secure AWS and Azure
cloud infrastructure, by providing foundational services such as SMTP, and
mirroring of Linux/Python packages.

I have research experience in quantum electrodynamics, high-power lasers, and
optical microcavities. I have deployed high-performance computing scientific
applications on multiple large computational clusters. I have mostly worked with
MPI, but I have done some OpenMP as well. See my [publications]({{ site.baseurl }}/articles) list for details.
