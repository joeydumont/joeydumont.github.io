Hi! I am a researcher at the Government of Canada. I have  experience in quantum
electrodynamics, high-power lasers, and optical microcavities. I have deployed
high-performance computing scientific applications on multiple large
computational clusters. I have mostly worked with MPI, but I have done some
OpenMP as well. See my [publications]({{ site.baseurl }}/articles) list for
details.
