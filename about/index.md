Hi! I'm a Ph. D. student at [INRS-ÉMT](http://www.emt.inrs.ca)
([<i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>](http://twitter.com/@INRS)).
I am currently working on the modeling of strong-field quantum electrodynamics processes
in the presence of tightly focused electromagnetic fields. I am interested in the
development of high-performance computing scientific applications designed
to be run on large computational clusters.
